# Chicago Crime Analysis and Prediction
Every day, hundreds and thousands of crimes happen in major cities of the United States. Different areas of a city, different dates and different times of a day may tend to have different types of crime. A successful classification of crime type given a time, a location and other relevant information will provide useful information for both the citizens and law enforcement agencies. For citizens, knowing that what type of crime can happen will help them be prepared. For law enforcement agencies, the information will help them allocate the resources better.

In this study, I utilized the historical crime record provided by the City of Chicago to build a crime classifier. I also integrate other relevant datasets (socioeconomic data) to improve the accuracy of the classification. Given time, location and information derived from time and location, this binary classifier is capable of classifying whether a crime is severe or not. The multiclass classifier is capable of classifying the exact type of crime. This study also provided helpful insights into the pattern of crime.
